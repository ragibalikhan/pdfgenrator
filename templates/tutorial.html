  <div class="section">
    <h2>Setting up the Data</h2>
    <p>Before we begin, we need to structure our data appropriately. Create a file called <strong>data.txt</strong> and populate it with the following information:</p>

    <pre class="code">
1, Videomate Banner, This a product known as the icon of Videomate, www.google.com
2, Videomate App Logo, This is also a product known as the App icon, www.google.com
3, Home Icon, This is a product known as an icon, but it is not the same, www.google.com
4, Videomate, This is a product known as the Videomate icon with an erased background, www.google.com
5, Home Icon 2, This is also a product known as an icon, www.google.com
6, Connect Logo, This is a product known as the Connect Fluence app icon, www.google.com
    </pre>

    <p>Each line represents an entry with the following structure: <strong>id, title, info, link</strong>. Make sure to use a comma (,) as the separator between each field. The id should correspond to the image number.</p>

    <p>For example, the first line represents image number 1, titled "Videomate Banner," with the information "This a product known as the icon of Videomate." The link field should contain the URL associated with the image.</p>

    <p>Ensure that the images referenced in <strong>data.txt</strong> are named according to their corresponding entry number. For instance, the image for the first entry should be named <strong>1.png</strong>, the second entry should have an image named <strong>2.png</strong>, and so on.</p>
